# littlereader

## Build

    clojure -T:build uber

## Run

    littlereader_image_url=https://your.images/are/served java -jar target/littlereader-standalone.jar

## Before you Run

Littlereader expects the following:

1. You have [Anki](https://ankisrs.net) running on the server (client doesn't need it)
2. The [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) plugin is
   configured and working on port 8765 (again, on the server)
3. You have one Anki deck named "Words" which comprises cards each with a target
   word on the front and nothing on the back
4. Optionally, that you're serving image files at littlereader_img_url, each of
   which is named after a target word, no extension. Those should be scaled and
   sized for quick loading.

## Extras

This repo has a `lemmas.clj' file that contains a thousand or so frequent
English lemmas. There's a button in the app that may or may not be working at
present that will let you add these gradually to your Anki deck without going
through Anki—you can of course do it in Anki too. I found this approach decent for ramping things up with your
child—at first he or she sees only ten words and gains confidence; then you add
them.

## Generating images

    A() {
        cd /var/www/html/littlereader-images
        local word;
        local url;
        while [[ -n $1 ]];
        do
            word="$1"
            url="$2"
            shift 2
            wget -O "$word" "$url"
            mogrify -geometry 800x "$word"
            timg "$word"
        done
    }

This is a bash function for preparing image files from stuff you found on Google
Image search or whatever. Usage:

    A dog https://images.com/pic-of-dog.jpg

Dependencies:

* Imagemagick cli
* wget
* [timg](https://github.com/hzeller/timg), optional.

Run it on the server and change `/var/www/...` to your actual htdoc dir.
